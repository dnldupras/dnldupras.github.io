                <h2>Formally</h2>
                <p>I am currently a student in my first year of computer science at John Abbott College.
                    My strengths are my resolute attitude in relation to projects and my ability to easily learn new things.
                    While I can pick things up fast I'm much stronger at dealing with more technical projects, not front end design.
                </p>
                <h2>Casually</h2>
                <p>I am an 19 year old montreal-born guy who has a passion for computers and tech. 
                    Ever since I was young I've loved tech and I don't forsee that changing any time soon.
                    I like to pass my time playing video games and chatting with friends, or sitting down to read a book and listen to music.
